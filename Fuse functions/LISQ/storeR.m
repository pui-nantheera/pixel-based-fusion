function [H, L] = storeR( F, levelF, o, H, L)
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% This function stores a two-dimensional gridfunction F into H for
% future extraction. Properties and location are stored in the book-
% keeping matrix L.
% This function is a two-dimensional lifting scheme utility. 
% 
% F = 2D gridfunction of coefficients
% 
% levelF = integer designated as the level of F
% 
% o = character, should be either 'a' or 'd',
%     describing the type of F:
%     'a' relates to approximation (coefficients) and
%     'd' relates to detail (coefficients)
%     other characters 'n' may be added to this list infuture versions
%
% L = 2D integer array of bookkeeping, its contents are updated by calls
%     to functions as storeQ, storeQ.... and does not require the
%     attention of the user.
%     L is organised as follows:
%       (for the j-th gridfunction F appended to H)
%       L(j, 1) = level of F as it has been assigned by the user.
%       L(j, 2) = 0 means that F corresponds to a rectangular domain,
%                   storeR always assigns this value. Functions like
%                   storeQ, storeQ.... assign values other than 0.
%       L(j, 3) = 0 stands for approximation type coefficients, 'a',
%                 1 stands for detail type coefficients, 'd'.
%       L(j, 4) = (integer) 1st dimension of gridfunction F.
%       L(j, 5) = (integer) 2nd dimension of gridfunction F.
%       L(j, 6) = integer that points to the end of the j-th
%                 addition to the heap.
%     With each call to storeR, storeQ, storeQ.... L obtains additional
%     row(s).
%
% H = 1D array that functions as storage (heap). The coefficients of F
%     are appended to H as a result of calling storeR. Bookkeeping is
%     maintained in L. No attention of the user is required.
